Introduction to Logical Operators
1-In the next concepts, you will be learning about Logical Operators. Logical Operators include:

2-LIKE This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.

3-IN This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for more than one condition.

4-NOT This is used with IN and LIKE to select all of the rows NOT LIKE or NOT IN a certain condition.

5-AND & BETWEEN These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.

6-OR This allows you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.


1-CREATE TABLE	is a statement that creates a new table in a database.
2-DROP TABLE	is a statement that removes a table in a database.
3-Entity-relationship diagram (ERD)	A common way to view data in a database.
4-FROM	specifies from which table(s) you want to select the columns. Notice the columns need to exist in this table.
5-SELECT	allows you to read data and display it. This is called a query and it specifies from which table(s) you want to select the columns.
